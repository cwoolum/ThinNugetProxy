# Thin Nuget Proxy

This is a super thin Nuget Proxy that is used to proxy connections to an Azure Artifacts Nuget Repository.

It is a super stripped down version of [BaGet](https://github.com/loic-sharma/BaGet)

## Usage

It is meant to be used as a Service Container in Azure Pipelines so that you can eliminate passing a PAT to your Docker builds allowing you to cache your image layers correctly.
